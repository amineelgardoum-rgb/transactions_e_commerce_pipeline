# Real-Time E-commerce Transaction Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end real-time data pipeline designed to simulate and process e-commerce transactions. It captures data from multiple sources, streams it through Apache Kafka, and stores it in MongoDB for persistence and future analysis.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The entire system is designed with decoupled services, making it scalable and resilient.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Data Streaming:** Utilizes Apache Kafka as a high-throughput, distributed message broker.
- **Multiple Data Sources:** Ingests data from two independent sources:
  - A **Faker**-based generator for producing realistic, mocked JSON data (`producer` service).
  - A **Mockoon** API simulator, mimicking a real-world third-party API (`producer-mockoon` service).
- **Decoupled Services:** Each component (producer, consumer) runs as a separate service, communicating only through the Kafka message bus.
- **FastAPI Producers:** Python-based Kafka producers are exposed via high-performance FastAPI endpoints.
- **Persistent Storage:** A Kafka consumer subscribes to the data stream and saves all incoming transactions to a **MongoDB** database.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes a **Chart.js** dashboard (`users_transactions_over_time` service) to demonstrate front-end consumption of the data.
- **Containerized Environment:** The entire stack is managed with Docker and Docker Compose for easy, one-command setup.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amineelgardoum-rgb/transactions_e_commerce_pipeline.git
   cd transactions_e_commerce_pipeline
   ```

---

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Project

The entire infrastructure can be launched with a single command thanks to Docker Compose.

1. **Start all services:**
   Run this command from the root of the project directory. The `-f` flag specifies the correct compose file, and `--build -d` will build the images if they don't exist and run the containers in detached mode.

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.project.yml up --build -d
   ```

   This will start:

   - Kafka and ZooKeeper
   - MongoDB
   - Two FastAPI producer services
   - The Kafka consumer service
2. **Verify the services are running:**
   To check the status of all containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.project.yml ps
   ```

   To view the real-time logs from all services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.project.yml logs -f
   ```    Press `Ctrl + C` to exit the logs.

   ```
3. **Interact with the APIs:**

   - **API Docs:**
     - **Source 1 (Faker):** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
     - **Source 2 (Mockoon):** [http://localhost:8001/docs](http://localhost:8001/docs)
   - **Sending Data:**
     - Use the docs to send a `POST` request to `/real_time_response` on the first API.
     - Use the docs to send a `POST` request to `/transactions` on the second API.
4. **Check the data in MongoDB:**
   You can connect to the MongoDB instance with a GUI client (like MongoDB Compass) or use the Docker container's shell:

   <br>

   1. **Enter the MongoDB shell:**
      ```bash
      docker-compose -f docker-compose.project.yml exec mongo mongosh
      ```
   2. **Show databases:**
      ```bash
      show dbs
      ```
   3. **Use the correct database:**
      ```bash
      use mocked_data
      ```
   4. **View the data:**
      ```bash
      db.transactions.find()
      ```
5. **Stop the services:**
   To stop and remove all the running containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.project.yml down
   ```

   To **also remove the data volumes** (deleting all MongoDB data):

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.project.yml down -v
   ```
